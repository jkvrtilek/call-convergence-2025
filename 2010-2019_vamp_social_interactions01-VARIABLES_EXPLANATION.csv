"","variable","explanation"
"1","study","the years of the study. Either Gerry Carter's PhD (2010-2014), postdoc work (2016-2017), or first field season of Carter Lab (2019)"
"2","dyad","actor and receiver pair"
"3","actor","groomer or food donor"
"4","receiver","groomee or food recipient"
"5","kinship","kinship based on microsatellite markers (see published papers for details) or parentage (when known)"
"6","actor.sex","sex of actor"
"7","receiver.sex","see above"
"8","actor.adult","is actor older than 2 years (if born in captivity) or fully developed based on epiphyseal gap (wild-caught), TRUE or FALSE"
"9","receiver.adult","see above"
"10","actor.age","age in years for 2010-2014 bats for the date 2014-10-07 (based on zoo birth records)"
"11","receiver.age","see above"

"13","possible.donation.sec","number of total seconds where actor could have been scored feeding receiver"
"14","donation.sec","number of total seconds where actor was scored feeding receiver (I did not include food sharing from 2019 because bats were not sampled well for food sharing (durations did not predict mass gain)"
"15","groom.sec","number of total seconds where actor was scored grooming receiver (I did not including grooming from 2010-2014 because bats were not sampled well for allogrooming)"
