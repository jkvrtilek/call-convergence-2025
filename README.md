This project uses a large dataset of vampire bat contact calls. Scripts used for analyses are provided here in R format (.R extension). For call detection and measurement scripts, please see call-detection repository. Data to reproduce these results will be made available on figshare. Folders named after R scripts contain items referred to in script and items generated by script, excluding items that will be required by future scripts.

This folder or directory has 6 scripts that should be run sequentially:

1. 01_get_acoustic_measuresXX.R

	- *Input data available on Figshare.*
	- Combines results from warbleR::spectro_analysis and fundamental frequency contour summary measures into one data frame.
	- *Product available on Figshare.*  
	
2. 02_transform_acoustic_measuresXX.R

    - Converts time variables into percentages
    - Scales all numeric variables to remove units
    - Removes calls with no fundamental frequency measures
    - *Product available on Figshare.*  
  
3. 03_get_vocal_distancesXX.R

    - Filters calls by minimum sample size
    - Generates plot showing number of bats included in analysis based on given minimum number of calls per bat
    - Classifies calls to bat using DFA (discriminant function analysis) with cross-validation (leave one-out classification) to get classification accuracy, generates classification matrix
    - Classifies calls to bat using a single DFA without cross validation to get vocal distances between bats, generates vocal distance matrix
    - Compares accuracy for DFAs with and without cross-validation, generates plot given minimum sample size
    - Gets and saves DFA loadings sorted by absolute value of LD1
    - Optional: compares observed accuracy to random classification rates (expected accuracies), generates csv and plot
    - *Product: vocal-distance-94-bats.csv*  

4. 04_combine_vocal_social_dataXX.R

    - Combines vocal data generated in 03_get_vocal_distancesXX.R with social data (see Figshare).
    - *Product: vocal_social_data.csv*  

5. 05_fit_modelsXX.R

    - MODEL 1: Does kinship predict contact call similarity?
    - MODEL 2: does kinship predict contact call similarity when conditioning on social experience?
    - MODEL 3: Does time together among non-kin predict contact call similarity?
    - MODEL 4: Does within-group contact rate predict contact call similarity?
    - MODEL 5: Does within-group non-kin food sharing predict contact call similarity?  
    
6. 06_test_convergence_over_timeXX.R

    - Creates figure showing all the recording dates for a subset of bats
          - 7 bats recorded pre- and post-introduction to a group of unfamiliar bats
          - the group of 5 unfamiliar bats
    - Classifies calls to bat using a single DFA without cross validation to get vocal distances between bats
          - For pre-introduction calls and unfamiliar bat calls
          - For post-introduction calls and now-familiar bat calls
    - Mantel test to compare similarity matrix with familiarity matrix
    - Finds number of introduced and familiar dyads with increased similarity
    - Runs a permuted DFA to determine classification accuracy
          - For pre-introduction calls and unfamiliar bat calls
          - For post-introduction calls and now-familiar bat calls
